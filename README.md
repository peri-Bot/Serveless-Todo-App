# Serverless TODO
A simple TODO application using AWS Lambda and Serverless framework. 

# Functionality of the application

This application will allow creating/removing/updating/fetching TODO items. Each TODO item can optionally have an attachment image. Each user only has access to TODO items that he/she has created.

# TODO items

The application stores TODO items, and each TODO item contains the following fields:

* `todoId` (string) - a unique id for an item
* `createdAt` (string) - date and time when an item was created
* `name` (string) - name of a TODO item (e.g. "Change a light bulb")
* `dueDate` (string) - date and time by which an item should be completed
* `done` (boolean) - true if an item was completed, false otherwise
* `attachmentUrl` (string) (optional) - a URL pointing to an image attached to a TODO item

## Prerequisites

* <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a> version up to 12.xx 
* Serverless 
   * Create a <a href="https://dashboard.serverless.com/" target="_blank">Serverless account</a> user
   * Install the Serverless Frameworkâ€™s CLI  (up to VERSION=2.21.1). Refer to the <a href="https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/" target="_blank">official documentation</a> for more help.
   ```bash
   npm install -g serverless@2.21.1
   serverless --version
   ```
   * Login and configure serverless to use the AWS credentials 
   ```bash
   # Login to your dashboard from the CLI. It will ask to open your browser and finish the process.
   serverless login
   # Configure serverless to use the AWS credentials to deploy the application
   # You need to have a pair of Access key (YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID and YOUR_SECRET_KEY) of an IAM user with Admin access permissions
   sls config credentials --provider aws --key YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID --secret YOUR_SECRET_KEY --profile serverless
   ```
   
# Functions to be implemented


* `Auth` - this function implements a custom authorizer for API Gateway that added to all other functions.

* `GetTodos` - returns all TODOs for a current user. A user id extracted from a JWT token that is sent by the frontend

It returns data that looks like this:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "todoId": "123",
      "createdAt": "2019-07-27T20:01:45.424Z",
      "name": "Buy milk",
      "dueDate": "2019-07-29T20:01:45.424Z",
      "done": false,
      "attachmentUrl": "http://example.com/image.png"
    },
    {
      "todoId": "456",
      "createdAt": "2019-07-27T20:01:45.424Z",
      "name": "Send a letter",
      "dueDate": "2019-07-29T20:01:45.424Z",
      "done": true,
      "attachmentUrl": "http://example.com/image.png"
    },
  ]
}
```

* `CreateTodo` - creates a new TODO for a current user. A shape of data send by a client application to this function can be found in the `CreateTodoRequest.ts` file

It receives a new TODO item to be created in JSON format that looks like this:

```json
{
  "createdAt": "2019-07-27T20:01:45.424Z",
  "name": "Buy milk",
  "dueDate": "2019-07-29T20:01:45.424Z",
  "done": false,
  "attachmentUrl": "http://example.com/image.png"
}
```

It returns a new TODO item that looks like this:

```json
{
  "item": {
    "todoId": "123",
    "createdAt": "2019-07-27T20:01:45.424Z",
    "name": "Buy milk",
    "dueDate": "2019-07-29T20:01:45.424Z",
    "done": false,
    "attachmentUrl": "http://example.com/image.png"
  }
}
```

* `UpdateTodo` - updates a TODO item created by a current user. A shape of data send by a client application to this function can be found in the `UpdateTodoRequest.ts` file

It receives an object that contains three fields that can be updated in a TODO item:

```json
{
  "name": "Buy bread",
  "dueDate": "2019-07-29T20:01:45.424Z",
  "done": true
}
```

The id of an item thats updated is passed as a URL parameter.

It returns an empty body.

* `DeleteTodo` - deletes a TODO item created by a current user. Expects an id of a TODO item to remove.

It returns an empty body.

* `GenerateUploadUrl` - returns a pre-signed URL that can be used to upload an attachment file for a TODO item.

It returns a JSON object that looks like this:

```json
{
  "uploadUrl": "https://s3-bucket-name.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/image.png"
}
```

All functions are already connected to appropriate events from API Gateway.

An id of a user can be extracted from a JWT token passed by a client.

# Frontend

The `client` folder contains a web application that can use the API that developed in the project.

This frontend should work with your serverless application once.

```ts
const apiId = '...' API Gateway id
export const apiEndpoint = `https://${apiId}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev`

```
# Database

To store TODO items,a DynamoDB table with local secondary index(es). 
```yml

TodosTable:
  Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
  Properties:
    AttributeDefinitions:
      - AttributeName: userId
        AttributeType: S
      - AttributeName: todoID
        AttributeType: S
      - AttributeName: createdAt
        AttributeType: S
    KeySchema:
      - AttributeName: userID
        KeyType: HASH
      - AttributeName: todoID
        KeyType: RANGE
    BillingMode: PAY_PER_REQUEST
    TableName: ${self:provider.environment.TODOS_TABLE}
    LocalSecondaryIndexes:
      - IndexName: ${self:provider.environment.INDEX_NAME}
        KeySchema:
          - AttributeName: userID
            KeyType: HASH
          - AttributeName: createdAt
            KeyType: RANGE
        Projection:
          ProjectionType: ALL # What attributes will be copied to an index

```

# How to run the application

## Backend

To deploy an application run the following commands:

```
cd backend
npm install
sls deploy -v
```

## Frontend

To run a client application first edit the `client/src/config.ts` file to set correct parameters. And then run the following commands:

```
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```

This should start a development server with the React application that will interact with the serverless TODO application.

# Postman collection

An alternative way to test your API, you can use the Postman collection that contains sample requests. You can find a Postman collection in this project. To import this collection, do the following.

Click on the import button:

![Alt text](images/import-collection-1.png?raw=true "Image 1")


Click on the "Choose Files":

![Alt text](images/import-collection-2.png?raw=true "Image 2")


Select a file to import:

![Alt text](images/import-collection-3.png?raw=true "Image 3")


Right click on the imported collection to set variables for the collection:

![Alt text](images/import-collection-4.png?raw=true "Image 4")

Provide variables for the collection (similarly to how this was done in the course):

![Alt text](images/import-collection-5.png?raw=true "Image 5")
